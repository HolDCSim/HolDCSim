# Week of 8/12/19

* Implemented a method which calculates and logs the average sleep state that each of the switches and servers has been in during the experiment
* Integrated the average sleep state value into the topology mapping for a k=4 topology
* Node color is now assigned to each node from the graph's color map depending on their average sleep state value
	* Color scale generated along with the graph to show what values the various colors represent\

### In Progress
* Building the k=8 topology graph
	* Color mapping and sleep state tracking should translate directly once the topology is built and graphed successfully
