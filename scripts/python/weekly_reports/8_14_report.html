<ul>
<li>Implemented a method which calculates and logs the average sleep state that each of the switches and servers has been in during the experiment</li>
<li>Integrated the average sleep state value into the topology mapping for a k=4 topology</li>
<li>Node color is now assigned to each node from the graphâ€™s color map depending on their average sleep state value
<ul>
<li>Color scale generated along with the graph to show what values the various colors represent<br />

<h3 id="in-progress">In Progress</h3>
<ul>
<li>Building the k=8 topology graph
<ul>
<li>Color mapping and sleep state tracking should translate directly once the topology is built and graphed successfully</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
