<hr />
<ol type="1">
<li>Reconfigured the output of the LCNetwork Experiment so it is more compact and more easily parsable</li>
<li>Solved the bug that was causing none of the switch sleep state transitions to be recorded properly</li>
<li>Implemented the graphing method for the switch traces and developed a python scripts to graph the data collected and output by the simulator
<ul>
<li>Can graph the total number of linecards in each sleep state</li>
<li>Can graph the sleep state traces for up to 8 specified linecards</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Further develop the topology generation using NetworX Python library</p></li>
<li><p>Further develop the output of the topology from the simulator so it can be easily graphed using NetworkX</p></li>
<li><p>Parameterize the sampling rate of the graphing methods to allow the user reduce the number of samples being graphed</p></li>
</ul>
