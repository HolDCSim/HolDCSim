<ol type="1">
<li>Modularized the graphing methods to better work with every experiment type</li>
<li>Found and fixed a bug with one of the graphs when experiment time/data set was too large</li>
<li>Found a python library to use to draw the topology – NetworkX
<ul>
<li>Working to create an output of the topology from the simulator in a format which I can use to draw the network using NetworkX</li>
<li>Have discussed with Kathy the way in which the topology data is formatted and stored</li>
<li>Will also use NetworkX to assign colors to each switch and server in the diagram equivalent to their average sleep state – generates a heat map of utilization across the network<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Example Figure generated with NetworkX:<br />
